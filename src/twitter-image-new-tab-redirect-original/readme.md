twitter-image-new-tab-redirect-original
==============
### WARNING! This user script will **`only run`** on the latest **`modern browsers`**<!--  that support **`top-level-await`** -->!  
  
- I'm very tired and anxious about "adding a lot of extraneous code and avoiding the latest features in order to write compatible code".  
So I will not actively writing code that's compatible with older browser engines.  
I wish I could concentrate on what I want to achieve.  
  
- However, I welcome anyone to fork my code and change it to be compatible,  
or even just throw my code into compatibility compilers like rollup, vite or webpack.


### Function

When you make a tweeted image open in a new tab, the image is automatically redirected to the original quality.  
Original quality, as defined by Twitter, is usually not really the original image.
