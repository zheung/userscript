### Attension before use!
This userscript would use features of `high-version ecmascript` and will only run in relatively new `modern browsers`!  
  
- I'm very tired and anxious about "adding a lot of extraneous code and avoiding the latest features in order to write compatible code".  
So I will not actively writing code that's compatible with older browser engines.  
I wish I could concentrate on what I want to achieve.  
  
- However, I welcome anyone to fork my code and change it to be compatible,  
or even just throw my code into compatibility compilers like rollup, vite or webpack.


### Script Function
When you make a tweeted image open in a new tab, the image is automatically redirected to the original quality.  
Original quality, as defined by Twitter, is usually not really the original image.
